# Description:

This Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) application demonstrates a simple client-server architecture for remote communication. RMI allows Java objects to invoke methods on remote objects running on different Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). In this application, we have a server component and a client component communicating over the network.

## 1. Hello Interface (Hello.java):
   - This interface extends `Remote` and declares a method `printHello()` that will be invoked remotely.
   - It throws `RemoteException`, which is a checked exception that indicates a communication-related exception that may occur during the execution of a remote method call.

## 2. HelloRemote Class (HelloRemote.java):
   - This class implements the `Hello` interface and extends `UnicastRemoteObject`.
   - It provides an implementation for the `printHello()` method, which simply returns a "Hello World.!" message.
   - In the `main()` method, it creates an instance of `HelloRemote`, binds it to the RMI registry using `Naming.rebind()`, and prints a message indicating that the server is running.

## 3. MyServer Class (MyServer.java):
   - This class represents the server-side of the application.
   - In the `main()` method, it creates an instance of `HelloRemote` and binds it to the RMI registry using `LocateRegistry.createRegistry()` and `rebind()`.
   - It listens for incoming client requests on port 1888 and binds the remote object with the name "myfirst" in the RMI registry.

## 4. **MyClient Class (MyClient.java):
   - This class represents the client-side of the application.
   - In the `main()` method, it looks up the remote object with the name "myfirst" in the RMI registry using `Naming.lookup()`.
   - It then invokes the `printHello()` method on the remote object and prints the returned message.

# Overall, this application demonstrates a basic example of using RMI in Java for remote communication between a server and a client. The server exposes a remote object with a method, and the client invokes that method remotely over the network.
